# News Lite 
An Android app which shows the 10 latest business articles from the Guardian.

## About

This app was made for the `News app` lesson in a free Udacity course provided by Google [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843). It is made specifically according to the rubric and was adapted from my own more liberal attempt at making it called `News` which you can find [here](https://github.com/Phobez/News).

## Why

I made this as part of my training to become an Android engineer at work.
